To understand more the why all this code is here, you should take a look at the [live app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.winhalla.app)
This is my first more-than-100-line project ever, that has been updated and refactor an embarassing amount of times.
It has an embarassing amount of code duplications, misoptimisation and an absence of documentation, that would take days to fix. As the gain would be close to zero since the project is no longer maintained, I decided to leave the project as is.
I learned the hard way that I should've documented this on the spot.
Also the abscence of types in JS is horrible to deal with when refactoring.

### Quick explaination of the code if you're brave enough to go here.
**Index.js**  
Entry point of the app, supposed to be the setup of the http server, but in the course of the last-minute commits, became home to multiple endpoints as well.

---

**models/***  
All files here represent MongoDB schemas for different document types. Some are here but were never used.

---
**requests/***  
An ancient reliquary of http requests to the [Brawlhalla API](https://dev.brawlhalla.com), these files are not used anymore and have been replaced by **utils/functions/callBrawlhallaApi.js**

---
**routes/***  
(Poorly organised) endpoints. They are the core of the app. Most are self-explanatory in their name, i'll go through the ones that aren't.  

**friendLink.js**: This is the referral link system.  
**sponsorships.js**: Track sponsorships results.  
**gamemodes/***: All things matches-related (see app) lobbyFFA.js for matchmaking, getFFA for inside the match and exit.js to exit the match. All other files are unused and were abandonned WIPs  
**solo/***: All things quest-related  

---
**utils/***   
Functions that are either here because routes files would be too long and unreadable or because they are used multiple times. I'll go through the most important ones

**callBrawlhallaApi.js**: Used to call the Brawlhalla API to get player's stats. This is used on so many places centralizing here was important.  
**checkEveryMin.js**: Basically a cron job, multiple functions here run every 1-5m to check for match end or quest end.  
**dailyChallenge.js**: 4 functions called by endpoints in index.js   
**ffaEnd.js**: calculate rewards at end of match and close match  
**solo/***: different utils to manage quests lifecycle

### A last word.
This code is not meant to be run by anyone, as adapting it to allow anyone to run it in standalone would take a long time, and it would have absoloutely no use.
It's merely an embarassing showcase of my own coding abilities when I started programming.

#### Why did I publish if it's embarassing? 
May it be embarassing, it shows that I was able to put together a website, an app and a backend while knowing barely anything about programming beforehand.
I know that this code is bad, but i know **why** it is bad. I know why because i learnt a lot since then.
I think seeing other people's newbie code helps new programmers not feel overwhelmed by the very neat code from (most) big libraries. This code may be bad code, but every file being mostly independent, you don't need to go through the whole code to understand a single file
